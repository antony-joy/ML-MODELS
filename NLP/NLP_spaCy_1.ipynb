    "A core difference between NLTK and spaCy stems from the way in which these libraries were built. NLTK is essentially a string processing library, where each function takes strings as input and returns a processed string. Though this seems like a simple way to use the library, in practice, you’ll often find yourself going back to the documentation to discover new functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, spaCy takes an object-oriented approach. Each function returns objects instead of strings or arrays. This allows for easy exploration of the tool. Developers don’t need to constantly check with documentation to understand context because the object itself provides it."

Now if we were to compute the similarities, I am happy and I am joyous would have the same tfidf/vector score as I am happy and I am sad, regardless of how we vectorize it. This is because 'happy', 'joyous' and 'sad' are considered to be completely different words. However, we know that happy and joyous are more similar to each other than sad. This is something that the vectorization techniques we've covered so far simply cannot capture."

The techniques used are beyond the scope of this course. However, once generated, these vectors can be used to discern how similar two words are to each other. Consequently, they can also be used to detect synonyms and antonyms. Word embeddings are also capable of capturing complex relationships. For instance, it can be used to detect that the words king and queen relate to each other the same way as man and woman. Or that France and Paris are related in the same way as Russia and Moscow.\n",

    "article=\"\"\"'\\ufeffThe taxi-hailing company Uber brings into very sharp focus the question of whether corporations can be said to have a moral character. If any human being were to behave with the single-minded and ruthless greed of the company, we would consider them sociopathic. Uber wanted to know as much as possible about the people who use its service, and those who don’t. It has an arrangement with unroll.me, a company which offered a free service for unsubscribing from junk mail, to buy the contacts unroll.me customers had had with rival taxi companies. Even if their email was notionally anonymised, this use of it was not something the users had bargained for. Beyond that, it keeps track of the phones that have been used to summon its services even after the original owner has sold them, attempting this with Apple’s phones even thought it is forbidden by the company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUber has also tweaked its software so that regulatory agencies that the company regarded as hostile would, when they tried to hire a driver, be given false reports about the location of its cars. Uber management booked and then cancelled rides with a rival taxi-hailing company which took their vehicles out of circulation. Uber deny this was the intention. The punishment for this behaviour was negligible. Uber promised not to use this “greyball” software against law enforcement – one wonders what would happen to someone carrying a knife who promised never to stab a policeman with it. Travis Kalanick of Uber got a personal dressing down from Tim Cook, who runs Apple, but the company did not prohibit the use of the app. Too much money was at stake for that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of people around the world value the cheapness and convenience of Uber’s rides too much to care about the lack of drivers’ rights or pay. Many of the users themselves are not much richer than the drivers. The “sharing economy” encourages the insecure and exploited to exploit others equally insecure to the profit of a tiny clique of billionaires. Silicon Valley’s culture seems hostile to humane and democratic values. The outgoing CEO of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, who is widely judged to have been a failure, is likely to get a $186m payout. This may not be a cause for panic, any more than the previous hero worship should have been a cause for euphoria. Yet there’s an urgent political task to tame these companies, to ensure they are punished when they break the law, that they pay their taxes fairly and that they behave responsibly.'\n",

L’usage morbide, par certains, de Facebook Live a amené son fondateur à annoncer précipitamment le recrutement de 3 000 modérateurs supplémentaires. Il est vrai que l’intelligence artificielle (IA) est bien en peine de reconnaître des contenus violents, surtout diffusés en direct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLe quotidien affreux de ces modérateurs, contraints de visionner des horreurs à longueur de journée, mériterait pourtant qu’on les remplace vite par des machines !\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL’IA ne peut pas tout, mais là où elle peut beaucoup, on la maudit, accusée de détruire nos emplois, de remplacer la convivialité humaine. Ce débat repose sur un malentendu.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIl vient d’une définition de l’IA qui n’a, dans la réalité, jamais pu être mise en pratique : en 1955, elle était vue comme la création de programmes informatiques qui, quoi qu’on leur confie, le feraient un jour mieux que les humains. On pensait que toute caractéristique de l’intelligence humaine pourrait un jour être si précisément décrite qu’il suffirait d’une machine pour la simuler. Ce n’est pas vrai.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAngoisses infondées\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nComme le dit un récent Livre blanc sur la question (Pourquoi il ne faut pas avoir peur de l’Intelligence arti\\xadficielle, Julien Maldonato, Deloitte, mars 2017), rien ne pourra remplacer un humain dans sa globalité.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL’IA, c’est de l’apprentissage automatique doté d’un processus d’ajustement de modèles statistiques à des masses de données, explique l’auteur. Il s’agit d’un apprentissage sur des paramètres pour lesquels une vision humaine n’explique pas pourquoi ils marchent si bien dans un contexte donné.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC’est aussi ce que dit le rapport de l’Office parlementaire d’évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques (« Pour une intelligence artificielle maîtrisée, utile et démystifiée », 29 mars 2017), pour qui ce côté « boîte noire » explique des angoisses infondées. Ethiquement, se fonder sur l’IA pour des tâches critiques sans bien comprendre le comment...\"\n",
